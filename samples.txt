Tasty and Quick Pasta:  Barilla Whole Grain Fusilli with Vegetable Marinara is tasty and has an excellent chunky vegetable marinara.  I just wish there was more of it.  If you aren't starving or on a diet, the 9oz serving is enough for lunch although you might want to add a piece of fruit to feel full.  The whole grain fusilli cooked to al dente tenderness following the instructions and the chunky marinara sauce is so good that I wished there was more of it.  Rarely do I eat sauce alone but this sauce is good enough to.

sooo good:  tastes so good. Worth the money. My boyfriend hates wheat pasta and LOVES this. cooks fast tastes great.I love this brand and started buying more of their pastas. Bulk is best.

Handy:  Love the idea of ready in a minute pasta and for that alone this product gets praise.  The pasta is whole grain so that's a big plus and it actually comes out al dente.  The vegetable marinara sauce is tasty, but has a high salt content - 710mg for a 9 oz. serving.<br /><br />It looks like much thought and testing went into creating the packaging, but I found it challenging.  You need to pull back the film to expose the sauce tray -- and not spill it.  I had to pull hard on the film, which made the sauce cup wiggle.  Easy to work around, but tricky nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all a step up from usual microwave in a minute fare.

Rustichella ROCKS!:  Anything this company makes is worthwhile eating! My favorite is their Trenne.<br />Their whole wheat pasta is the best I have ever had.

Wonderful:  Came quickly. Was plentiful and delicious and cheaper than in the store. You will enjoy it if you like thick pasta.
